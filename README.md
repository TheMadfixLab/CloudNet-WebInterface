# CloudNet WebInterface RestAPI

## Description
The Material Design Web Interface has all the features you need to manage your Cloud Simple and easy.
We pay attention to quality, stability and future-proof approaches.
This is the CloudNet web interface for managing features from the cloud. The web interface brings the following features from CloudNet:

| Feature                    | Supported |
|:-------------------------- |:--------- |
| Mob Mangement              | :hammer:  |
| Cloud Permission Mangement | :rocket:  |
| Wrapper Mangement          | :rocket:  |
| Sign Mangement             | :rocket:  |
| ServerGroup Mangement      | :rocket:  |
| ProxyGroup Mangement       | :rocket:  |
| Server Mangement           | :rocket:  |
| Proxy Mangement            | :rocket:  |

All graphical functions are based purely on HTML, CSS, JavaScript. To generate the respective files the framework Angluar CLI is used. Thereby we rely on a pure **material design** which makes us stand out.

**Material Design**  
The Material Design is a design standard created by Google to create simple and clear surfaces. We use this standard to make our web interface user friendly.

**Functions of the interface itself**  
In order to guarantee the handiness and stability, the web interface also has its own functions. 
Own implemented functions without dependencies on CloudNet:
